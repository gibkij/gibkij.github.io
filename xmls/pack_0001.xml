Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
&gt;B
Or knackered Converse
&gt;B
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
&gt;E 
But all of that's what the point is not
&gt;                      Em
The point's that there ain't no romance around there
&gt;B
And there's the truth that they can't see
&gt;B
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
&gt;B    E
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
&gt;Em
Agree that there ain't no romance around there
(The verses are all upstroked, like kinda ska rythm n that)
 
Chorus:
&gt;   Abm         F#   
You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
&gt;    E
We'll tell 'em if you like
&gt;    Em
We'll tell 'em all tonight
&gt;         B
They'll never listen
&gt;        Abm
Cause their minds are made up
&gt;   C#m              F#           B
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

&gt;B
And over there there's broken bones
&gt;B
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
&gt;E
 And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
&gt;              Em
To see it's a little different around here
&gt;B
Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
&gt;B
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
&gt;E
And just cause he's had a coupla cans
&gt;                  Em
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Chorus:
&gt;   Abm         F#   
You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
&gt;    E
We'll tell 'em if you like
&gt;    Em
We'll tell 'em all tonight
&gt;         B
They'll never listen
&gt;        Abm
Cause their minds are made up
&gt;   C#m              F#
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

Cause their minds are made up
&gt;   C#m              F#
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

&gt;     Abm
I said no
&gt;  F#
Oh no!
&gt;     E          Em
Oh you won't get me to go!
&gt;B      Abm
Anywhere, said anywhere
&gt; C#m     F#
I won't Go
&gt;       B
Oh no no!

&gt;B
Well over there there's friends of mine
&gt;B
What can I say, I've known 'em for a long long time
&gt;E
And yeah they might overstep the line
&gt;                Em          B
But I just cannot get angry in the same way
&gt;B
Not in the same way
&gt;           E
Not in the same way
&gt;         Em
Oh no, oh no no

      <track id="Arabella">&gt;Intro: Em Am G | Em Am 

&gt;G                     Em                        Am 
Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots 
&gt;      G                          Em                     Am  G 
And a helter skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it 
endlessly 
&gt;              Em                    Am 
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit 
&gt;         G                           Em            Am     G 
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip 
in my daydreams 
 
&gt;Em                          Am              G 
     My days end best when this sunset gets itself 
&gt;Em                        Am          G            Em 
      Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side 
&gt;                Am                  G          Em 
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light 
&gt; Em 
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes 
&gt;Em G Em Am Em G Em Bm 
                  As Arabella 
&gt;Em G Em Am Em G Em Bm 
                  As Arabella 
&gt;Em      G          Em       Am      Em        G   Em Bm

Every day you'll hear me say... 
 
Baby, I'm yours, 
And I'll be yours until two and two is three, 
Yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea, 
In other words, until eternity. 
 
Baby, I'm yours, 
Till the stars fall from the sky, 
Baby, I'm yours, 
Till the rivers all run dry, 
Baby, I'm yours, 
Until the sun no longer shines, 
Baby, I'm yours, 
Till the poets run out of rhyme

Running off over next doors garden 
&gt;  D                Bm 
Before the hour is done 
&gt;     Bm                 F#m 
It's more a question of feeling 
&gt;        D                F#m 
Than it is a question of fun 
&gt;    Bm                F#m 
The confidence is the balaclava 
&gt;    D                      Bm 
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good 
&gt;         Bm             F#m 
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks 
&gt;    D             F#m 
And runny makeup alone 
 
Or will blood run down the face 
Of a boy bewildered and scorned 
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish 
And you wish you'd never been born 
And you tie yourself to the tracks 
And there isn't no going back 
And it's wrong wrong wrong 
But we'll do it anyway cause we love a bit of trouble 
 
Are you pulling her from a burning building 
Or throwing her to the sharks 
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start 
The confidence is the balaclava, i'm sure you baffle 'em straight 
And its wrong wrong wrong, she can hardly wait 
 
&gt;Bm                                F#m 
That's right, he won't let her out his sight 
&gt;                   Bm 
Now the shaggers perform 
&gt;                    F#m 
And the daggers are drawn 
&gt;                     Bm 
Who's the crooks in this crime? 
 
That's right, he won't let her out his sight 
Now the shaggers perform 
And the daggers are drawn 
Who's the crooks in this.... 
Crime! 
 
That's right, he wont let her out his sight 
That's right, he wont let her out his sight 
That's right, he wont let her out his sight 
 
You'll be able to post any day of the most 
For the sights of all time 
 
You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss 
Quiet and assuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest 
She pleaded with you to take it off 
But you resisted and fought 
Sorry sweetheart, I'd much rather keep on the balaclava.

You were practicing a magic trick

On the last of your pick and mix

Your past-times, consisted of the strange

Straighten the rudder girl

Who cares

&gt;Em                          C        Am
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
&gt;Am                                      Em
D'you ever get that fear that you can't shift
&gt;Em
The type that sticks around like summet in your teeth?
&gt;Em        C          Am
Have some aces up your sleeve?
&gt;Am                              Em
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
&gt;Em
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
&gt;Em       C             Am
How many secrets can you keep?
&gt;Am                                       Em
'Cause there's this tune I've found that makes me think of you 
somehow 
&gt;Em
And I play it on repeat
&gt;C     Am
Until I fall asleep
&gt;Am                    B
Spillin' drinks on my settee 

Pre-chorus:
&gt;C
Do I wanna know?
&gt;Am 
If this feelin' flows both ways?
&gt;       Em
Sad to see you go
&gt;Em
Sorta hopin' that you'd stay 
&gt;        C
Darlin' we both know
&gt;Am
That the nights were mainly made for sayin' things 
that you can't say 
&gt;Em
tomorrow day

Chorus:
&gt;                 Em
Crawlin' back to you
&gt;Em              C
Ever thought of callin'
&gt;Am
When, you've 'ad a few 
&gt;                Em
'Cause I always do
&gt;Em
Maybe I'm too
&gt;Em          C          Am
Busy bein' yours, to fall for, somebody new
&gt;                   Em
Now I've thought it through,
&gt;Em
Crawlin' back to you.

Verse:
&gt;C (1 strum)       Am  (1 strum)
So 'ave you got the guts?
&gt;                       Am (1)        Em (1)
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
&gt;       Em (1)     Em (1)
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
&gt;C (1)         Am (1)
Simmer down and pucker up
&gt;                            Em (1)
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of 
Tryin'
&gt;C       Am                              Em           (stop)
To kiss you, but I dunno if you, feel the same as I do
&gt;Em             C     Am
   We could be together, 
&gt;Am            B
If you wanted to.

Pre-Chorus 2: repeat pre-chorus 1

Chorus 2: repeat chorus 1

&gt;C                                         Am
Do I wanna know, if this feelin' flows both ways?
&gt;Am     Em
Sad to see you go, was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

&gt;C                            Am                                 Em
Darlin' we both know, that the nights were mainly made for sayin' 
things that 
&gt;Em
you can't say tomorrow day

Outro verse:
&gt;C (1) (stop)                  Am
Do I wanna know? Too busy bein' yours to fall
&gt;Am     Em
Sad to see you go,
&gt;Em              C
Ever thought of callin' darlin' 
&gt;Am                              C              Am             Em
&gt;Do I wanna know? Do you want me crawlin' back to you? (End on Em)

Have you got colour in your cheeks? 
&gt;Cm                                          Gm
Do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide 
That sticks around like something's in your teeth 
&gt;          Eb             Cm
And some aces up your sleeve 
&gt;                              Gm
I had no idea that you're in deep 
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week 

&gt;           Eb               Cm
How many secrets can you keep?
&gt;            Gm 
Cause there's this tune I found 
that makes me think of you somehow
When I play it on repeat 
&gt;   Eb    Cm
Until I fall asleep 
&gt;                        D
Spilling drinks on my settee 

Pre-Chorus:
&gt;          Eb
(Do I wanna Know ) 
&gt;          Cm
If this feeling floats both ways 
&gt;          Gm
(I had to see you Go ) 
Cause I've been hoping that you'd stay
&gt;          Eb 
(And now that we both know ) 
&gt;          Cm
That the nights were mainly made the same 
&gt;          Gm
And things that you can't say some other day 

Chorus:
&gt;                  Gm
Crawling back to you 
&gt;                     Eb       Cm
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
&gt;               Gm
Cause I always Do
&gt;                              Eb       Cm
Well baby I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
&gt;                     Gm
Now I've thought it through

&gt;                  Gm
Crawling back to you 

So have you got the goods? 
Been wondering if you're heart's still open 
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts 
Simmer down, pucker up 
And I'm sorry to interrupt 
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp 
Of trying to kiss you 
I don't know if you feel the same as I Do 
We could be together if you wanted to 

Pre-Chorus:
With this feeling first on the plate 
Cause I've been hoping that you'd state 
That the nights were never engraved 
For saying things that you can't say some other day 

Chorus:
Crawling back to you 
And I thought I'd crawl in here, give it a few 
As I always Do 
Waking up to 
Was it me and yours to fall first from loving you? 
And I tell it true 
Crawling back to you

I can't explain but I wanna try
&gt;   Bb        Dm
There's this image of you and I
&gt;Bb
And it goes dancing by
&gt;Gm                   Dm
In the morning and the night time
&gt;Dm                Dm
There's all these secrets I can't keep
&gt;Dm                 Dm 
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite

And you lived there so long
&gt;Gm                       Dm
It's kind of strange now you're gone

Припев:
&gt; Dm            Bb
I'm not sure if I should
&gt;              Gm
Show you what I've found
&gt;G           Bb
Has it gone for good
&gt;                Gm
Or is it coming back around?
&gt;Am                Bb
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
&gt;Gm
When you're losing

And your fuse is Fireside

Куплет 2:

There's all those places we used to Go
&gt;Dm                Dm
And I suspect that you already know
&gt;Bb
But that place on memory lane
&gt;       G
You like still looks the same
&gt;                  Dm
But something about it's changed

Припев:
&gt; Dm            Bb
I'm not sure if I should

Show you what I've found

Has it gone for good

Isn't it hard to make up your mind

When you're losing

And your fuse is Fireside

Запев:
&gt;F      Bb       Gm   
And I thought I was yours, Forever
&gt;Bb           Gm
Or maybe I was mistaken,
&gt;         Bb              
But I just can't help manage to

Get through the day without thinking of you lately
 
&gt;Dm  Gm  Bb  Gm  Dm 

Припев:

I'm not sure if I should

Show you what I've found

Has it gone for good

Or is it coming back around?

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end, keep imagining meeting,

Wished away entire lifetimes, unfair we're not somewhere

Misbehaving for days, great escape lost track of time and space

She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

Verse:
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

&gt;  Am                 
Despair to the point till they provoke
&gt;    Am                      
The punchline before they have told the joke
&gt;    Am               
The sheer desperation to be seen
&gt; Am                
Staring at the television screen

&gt;  Am                     
Despair to the point where they provoke
&gt;                  Am                      
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
&gt;Am                 
Sorry sunshine it doesn't exist
&gt;   Am              
It wasn't in the top 100 list

&gt;          F                E
And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder,
&gt;Am
Don't be surprised when you get bent over,
&gt;F       E                  D# 
He told ya, that you were gagging for it

&gt;   Am                      
She saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
&gt;   Am                   
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
&gt; Am                
Another variation on a theme
&gt;           Am               
&gt;A tangle on the television and the magazine
&gt;    Am                   
D'you reckon that they Do it for a joke?
&gt;    Am                      
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
&gt;           Am   
That says "we are defenders
&gt;   Am              Am         
Of any poseur or professional pretender around"

&gt;          F           E
When did your list replace the twist and turn?
&gt;     Am
Ah the fist, replaced the kissed-on concern
&gt;F                            E
And if you're bothered, I don't want your prayers

Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder,

Don't be surprised when you get bent over,

He told ya, that you were gagging for it

Lets have a game on the Teddy Picker

Not quick enough can I have it quicker?

Already thick and you're getting thicker

Verse 1:  
&gt;       Em                         Bb7  
The smiles as she walked in the room 
&gt;       Dm                            Am  
have all turned into frowns am I too quick to assume

that the love is no longer in bloom 
&gt;        Dm                            Am

And the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around When you 
&gt;  Em                 Bb7                        Dm  
sobbed before it felt much more like the product of the squabble 
&gt;  Am  
Now there's reason for it to be something more 
 
Chorus:  
&gt;   Am  
And there would be

Oh its uncertain whether the curtain has shut for good She

said "see if it's still raining but I'm not dressed for it, and  
if you loved me..." 
&gt;                                          Bb7  
And I interrupt to receive the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there  
 
Verse 2: (Turner sings as he plays the riff) 
 
Would it be too outrageous to say 
We're either shouting or we're shagging locked 
in tempestuous phase 
At least that's how we felt yesterday 
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're sleep or ...

Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
She don't stop in the winter, no and...
